# Exercise 01: Reverse Polish Notation

For this second exercise, you have to find a makefile with the usual compilation rules and the files requested in the subject. 

### Code review

Check that a makefile is present with the usual compilation rules.

Check in the code that the program uses at least one container.

The person being evaluated must explain why they chose to
use this container and not another?

If not, the evaluation stops here.

If the container chosen here is present in the first exercise
then the evaluation stops here.

### Main usage

Check that the program runs correctly using different formulas of your choice.

The program is not required to handle expressions with parenthesis or decimals
number.

If there is any problem during the execution then the evaluation stops here.

### Usage advanced

Check that the program runs correctly using different formulas of your choice.

Here is some tests:
```
8 9 * 9 - 9 - 9 - 4 - 1 +
> Result: 42
	
9 8 * 4 * 4 / 2 + 9 - 8 - 8 - 1 - 6 -
> Result: 42
	
1 2 * 2 / 2 + 5 * 6 - 1 3 * - 4 5 * * 8 / 
> Result: 15
```

You can use the examples in the topic if you don't know which formula to use.
If there is any problem during the execution then the evaluation stops here.
